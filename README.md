Prime is a python package that allows to derive the weak field Lagrangians of any
geometry by the gravitational closure mechanism.

# Overview

## Gravitational Closure

Gravitational closure is a theoretical mechanism that allows to calculate the Lagrangian
of a geometry by solving a system of linear homogeneous differential equations.
